# 📚 100 Days of Python – My Refresher Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **100 Days of Python** repository! 🐍 This is my journey through **100 days of coding**, refreshing and deepening my Python skills. Each day, I'll tackle a new project, covering various Python concepts from basics to advanced topics.

**Why this repo?**  
- To document my progress and revisit concepts anytime.  
- To reinforce Python fundamentals while exploring new libraries and techniques.  
- To build a collection of small yet meaningful projects.

## 📂 Structure
Each day's project is stored in its own directory, following this format:

```
📁 Day_01
    ├── main.py
📁 Day_02
    ├── main.py
📁 Day_03
    ├── main.py
...
```

## 🚀 Running a Project
To run a specific day's project, navigate to the corresponding directory and execute:

```sh
cd Day_05  # Example: Go to Day 5's project
python main.py
```

Ensure you have **Python 3** installed. Some projects might require additional libraries, which will be listed in `requirements.txt` if needed.

## 🌱 About This Challenge
This course serves as a structured refresher, revisiting key Python concepts while building practical projects. Inspired by **100 Days of Python** on Udemy, I'm making this my own by adding custom touches and insights along the way.
